\section*{Rubric Report}

\noindent **Overall Impression:** The speaker demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic and presents information in a generally organized manner. However, there is room for improvement in delivery and the integration of supporting evidence.

\noindent **Tone/Inflection:** The speaker's tone was generally appropriate, but lacked consistent inflection. Varying vocal delivery more would keep the audience engaged. Consider practicing emphasizing key points and modulating your voice to create a more dynamic presentation. Perhaps practice in front of a mirror or record yourself to analyze areas for improvement.

\noindent **Information:** The speaker provided good, relevant information. The choice of information was apt for a general audience.

\vspace{0.1in}
\noindent **Use of Facts/Statistics:** The weakest area. The speaker could significantly improve by incorporating more concrete facts, statistics, or data points to support their claims. Without these, arguments can feel less persuasive. Research and integrate specific examples to bolster arguments. Make sure to cite your sources if applicable.

\vspace{0.1in}
\noindent **Organization:** The speaker's presentation was well-organized and easy to follow. The logical flow of information was clear and structured, making it easy for the audience to understand the message. Consider using visual aids like bullet points in slides to summarize information.

\vspace{0.1in}
\noindent **Understanding of Topic:** The speaker demonstrated a strong grasp of the subject matter. Their ability to explain complex concepts clearly indicates a deep understanding. Continue to build upon this knowledge base.

\vspace{0.1in}
\noindent **Recommendations:** Focus on improving vocal delivery through practice and incorporating more specific evidence to support claims. Continued effort in these areas will significantly enhance the impact and credibility of future presentations. By incorporating facts and statistics, arguments become stronger and the presentation will become more compelling.
